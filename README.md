# Authentication Zero

The purpose of authentication zero is to generate a pre-built authentication system into a rails application (web or api-only) that follows both security and rails best practices. By generating code into the user's application instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom to modify the authentication system so it works best with their app.

## Features

- **Simplest code ever (~200 lines of code)**
- **Inspired by hey.com**
- Sign up
- Email and password validations
- Checks if a password has been found in any data breach (--pwned)
- Authentication by cookie
- Authentication by token (--api)
- Two factor authentication (--two-factor)
- Social Login with OmniAuth (--omniauthable)
- Verify email using a link with token
- Verify email using a six random digits code for api (--code-verifiable)
- Ask password before sensitive data changes, aka: sudo (--sudoable)
- Reset the user password and send reset instructions
- Reset the user password only from verified emails
- Lock sending reset password email after many attempts (--lockable)
- Send e-mail confirmation when your email has been changed
- Send e-mail notification when someone has logged into your account
- Manage multiple sessions & devices
- Activity log (--trackable)
- Log out
- [API documentation](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero/blob/master/authentication-zero-api.md)

## Security and best practices

- [has_secure_password](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password): Adds methods to set and authenticate against a BCrypt password.
- [signed cookies](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html): Returns a jar that'll automatically generate a signed representation of cookie value and verify it when reading from the cookie again.
- [httponly cookies](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html): A cookie with the httponly attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript, this precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- [signed_id](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/SignedId.html): Returns a signed id that is tamper proof, so it's safe to send in an email or otherwise share with the outside world.
- [Current attributes](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html): Abstract super class that provides a thread-isolated attributes singleton, which resets automatically before and after each request.
- [Action mailer](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html): Action Mailer allows you to send email from your application using a mailer model and views.
- [Log filtering](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#log-filtering): Parameters 'token' and 'password' are marked [FILTERED] in the log.
- [Functional Tests](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#functional-tests-for-your-controllers): In Rails, testing the various actions of a controller is a form of writing functional tests.
- [System Testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#system-testing): System tests allow you to test user interactions with your application, running tests in either a real or a headless browser.

## Installation

Add this lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "authentication-zero"
```

Then run `bundle install`

You'll need to set the root path in your routes.rb, for this example let's use the following:

```ruby
root "home#index"
```

```
rails generate controller home index
```

Add these lines to your `app/views/home/index.html.erb`:

```html+erb
<p style="color: green"><%= notice %></p>

<% if signed_in? %>
  <p>Signed as <%= Current.user.email %></p>

  <div>
    <%= link_to "Change email address", edit_identity_email_path %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= link_to "Change password", edit_password_path %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= link_to "Devices & Sessions", sessions_path %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%# link_to "Activity Log", authentications_events_path %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%# link_to "Two-Factor Authentication", new_two_factor_authentication_totp_path %>
  </div>

  <br>

  <%= button_to "Log out", Current.session, method: :delete %>
<% else %>
  <p>You are not signed in. <%= link_to "Sign in", sign_in_path %> or <%= link_to "sign up", sign_up_path %>.</p>
<% end %>
```

And you'll need to set up the default URL options for the mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

## Usage

```
rails generate authentication
```

Then run `bundle install` again!

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
